BASIC USAGES

1. Browser

In browser, you should see two icons types: folders and albums.

All folders have the same grey icon representing a folder and all recognized albums are identified by their cover thumbnail. Other not recognized files are not shown.

If you want to open a folder with images and other recognized files, it will ask you if you want to open it as an album or a normal folder.

Folders named ".." are parent folders.

If you click on a folder icon, it will refresh all thumbnails with its new content.

Just browse to the folder containing the album you want to open and click on it to open it.

2. Viewer

Once your album is open, you should see the first page.

If you want to use your keyboard, you can use left and right arrows to go to previous or next page.
If you want to use your touchscreen, you can touch the screen with a finger and move it to the right or the left to respectively go to next or previous image.

The default zoom mode is to adapt the page size to the width of the screen. You can change this by going in "Settings".

If your page is larger than screen you can scroll in both vertical or horizontal directions.

You can navigate to specific pages using "Menu" button -> "Go to page" or "Search" button if available on your device.
